# Data-Analytics---Waze
As part of the Advanced Googe Data Analytics Course, I investigate the User churn of the Navigation App, Waze

**[Waze PACE strategy document.pdf](https://github.com/olidare/Data-Analytics---Waze/tree/main#:~:text=Waze%20PACE%20strategy%20document.pdf)**

Firstly, I set out the project plan using PACE in this document.



**[Waze - Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/olidare/Data-Analytics---Waze/blob/main/Waze%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)**

This Notebook is to investigate and understand the data provided to gain comprehensive insights into its structure, content, and potential analytical value.

**Phase 1: Contextual Understanding**

* Assess the business context and requirements
* Identify key questions the data needs to answer
* Establish a structured approach for organizing and analyzing the information

**Phase 2: Understand the data**

* Construct a pandas dataframe optimized for analysis
* Generate descriptive statistics and summary metrics
* Document initial observations and potential areas of interest
* Identify data quality issues requiring attention

**Part 3: Variable Analysis**

* Conduct targeted examination of key variables based on initial findings
* Explore relationships between variables
* Identify patterns, outliers, and potential insights
* Document variable characteristics to guide subsequent analysis


**[Waze - Hypothesis Test.ipynb](https://github.com/olidare/Data-Analytics---Waze#:~:text=Waze%20%2D%20Hypothesis%20Test.ipynb)**

Following EDA, we wan to further analyze the relationship between mean amount of rides and device type:

* The goal is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python.
* The purpose of this project is to demostrate knowledge of how to conduct a two-sample hypothesis test.
