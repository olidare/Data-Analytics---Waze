# Data-Analytics---Waze
As part of the Advanced Googe Data Analytics Course, I investigate the User churn of the Navigation App, Waze


Firstly, I set out the project plan using PACE in this document below.

**[Waze PACE strategy document.pdf](https://github.com/olidare/Data-Analytics---Waze/tree/main#:~:text=Waze%20PACE%20strategy%20document.pdf)**


Then I conduct Exploratory Data Analysis using Python in this Jupyter Notebook.
