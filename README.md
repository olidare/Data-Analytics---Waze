# Data-Analytics---Waze
As part of the Advanced Googe Data Analytics Course, I investigate the User churn of the Navigation App, Waze

### Background on the Waze scenario 
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

In this project we will analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions, to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. 

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

* Who are the users most likely to churn?

* Why do users churn? 

* When do users churn? 

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may lose these users without knowing why. 

The insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.

## PACE Strategy

**[Waze PACE strategy document.pdf](https://github.com/olidare/Data-Analytics---Waze/tree/main#:~:text=Waze%20PACE%20strategy%20document.pdf)**

Firstly, I set out the project plan using PACE in this document.

________

## Waze - Exploratory Data Analysis

**[Waze - Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/olidare/Data-Analytics---Waze/blob/main/Waze%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)**

This Notebook is to investigate and understand the data provided to gain comprehensive insights into its structure, content, and potential analytical value.

**Phase 1: Contextual Understanding**

* Assess the business context and requirements
* Identify key questions the data needs to answer
* Establish a structured approach for organizing and analyzing the information

**Phase 2: Understand the data**

* Construct a pandas dataframe optimized for analysis
* Generate descriptive statistics and summary metrics
* Document initial observations and potential areas of interest
* Identify data quality issues requiring attention

**Part 3: Variable Analysis**

* Conduct targeted examination of key variables based on initial findings
* Explore relationships between variables
* Identify patterns, outliers, and potential insights
* Document variable characteristics to guide subsequent analysis

## Waze - Basic Statistical Analysis (Hypothesis Test in Python)

**[Waze - Hypothesis Test.ipynb](https://github.com/olidare/Data-Analytics---Waze/blob/main/Waze%20-%20Hypothesis%20Test.ipynb)**


Following EDA, we wan to further analyze the relationship between mean amount of rides and device type:

* The goal is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python.
* The purpose of this project is to demostrate knowledge of how to conduct a two-sample hypothesis test.
